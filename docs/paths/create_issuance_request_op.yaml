    summary: Create issuance request
    description: |
      Allows to create request to emit provided amount of specified asset to destination balance.
      Issuance request is a reviewable request. It uses tasks - bitmask, where each bit represents conditions under which
      request can be approved. Tasks can be set or cleared both manually and automatically.
      Tasks bit mask can be provided either from `KeyValueEntry` by key `issuance_tasks:<asset_code>` (which specify tasks
      for asset) or by key `issuance_tasks:*` is there are no tasks for provided asset.
      If field `allTasks` is set in request, `KeyValueEntry` won't be used.
