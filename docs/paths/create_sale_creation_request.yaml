    summary: Create sale creation request
    description: |
      Allows to create reviewable request which on approval will create sale for base asset.
      Quote assets are assets in which investments can be made.
      Base asset is an asset being sold.
      #### Sale types
      There are 4 types of sale:
      * Basic: For basic sale price of base asset is locked for every quote asset.
         Amount of tokens distributed between participants depends on amount of contribution
         and price of base asset in terms of quote asset in which contribution was made.
      * Crowdfunding: prices are not set. If sale was successful (soft cap was reached),
        all tokens (max amount to be sold) are distributed between participants according to their contributions.
      * Fixed price: price is locked only in default quote asset.
        Amount of tokens distributed between participants depends only on capitalization on sale close.
      * Immediate: price is locked only in default quote asset.
        Participants receive tokens being sold on sale immediatelly after making offer.
        Sale is considered successful even if soft cap was not reached.
