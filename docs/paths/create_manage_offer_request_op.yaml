    summary: Create manage offer request
    description: |
      Allows to create request to make offer in some asset pair or participate in sale.
      ManageOffer request is a reviewable request. It uses tasks - bitmask, where each bit represents conditions under which
      request can be approved. Tasks can be set or cleared both manually(by reviewer) and automatically.
      Tasks bit mask can be provided from `KeyValueEntry`.
      If field `allTasks` is set, `KeyValueEntry` won't be used.
